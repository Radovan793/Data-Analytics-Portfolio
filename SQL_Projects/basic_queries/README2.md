# Basic SQL Queries

This file contains a collection of **basic SQL practice queries** designed to demonstrate foundational SQL concepts and patterns.  

### Concepts Covered
- Subqueries using `IN`
- `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS`
- Filtering and simple joins
- Basic aggregation and distinct values

### Notes
- Queries assume tables like `clients`, `invoices`, `products`, and `order_items`.
- Example outputs are included in comments for clarity.
- No sample dataset is required; the focus is on query logic.
