# Advanced SQL Queries

This folder contains a collection of advanced SQL queries demonstrating analytical and data processing skills.  
Each query is focused on solving a specific real-world problem using window functions, CTEs, and ranking techniques.

## Queries Included

1. **Find Duplicate Records**  
   - Detects duplicate entries in a table based on a unique key.  
   - Demonstrates use of `ROW_NUMBER()` window function.

2. **Top 3 Employees by Salary per Department**  
   - Fetches top earners in each department using `RANK()`.  
   - Useful for HR analytics and performance reporting.

3. **Cities with 3+ Consecutive Cold Days**
