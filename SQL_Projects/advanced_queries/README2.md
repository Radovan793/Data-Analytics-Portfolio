# Advanced SQL Queries

This file contains a collection of **advanced SQL practice queries** for more complex scenarios and analytical calculations.

### Concepts Covered
- Correlated subqueries
- Aggregations with `HAVING`
- Subqueries inside `SELECT` clauses
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for readability
- Calculating per-client totals, averages, and differences
- Combining multiple query steps for analysis

### Notes
- Queries assume tables like `clients`, `invoices`, `employees`, `products`, and `order_items`.
- Example outputs are included in comments to show expected results.
- Focus is on SQL problem-solving techniques rather than providing a dataset.
