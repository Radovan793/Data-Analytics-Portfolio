# Python Classes Mini-Projects

This folder contains **Python class examples and mini-projects** to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.  
These examples are suitable for learning, reference, or showcasing on GitHub.

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Basic class definitions** – simple objects with attributes and methods.  
- **State management** – objects that track their own status (e.g., started/stopped).  
- **Advanced functionality** – fuel, acceleration, braking, driving simulations.  
- **Factory and class methods** – create pre-configured objects.  
- **Auto-incremented IDs** – tracking object instances automatically.  
- **Utility classes** – examples like `Rectangle` and `TimeClass`.  
- **Class vs. instance methods** – understanding static vs. dynamic behavior in classes.
